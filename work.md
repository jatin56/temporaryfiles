# 21. Light
### Find objects in room
For this game, you have a room full of objects and in light sources you have multiple options such as torch, table lamp, candle, and aldo some non light emitting sources such as a glaas, reflective ball etc.
As the object is dragged into the room we need to show the effect of its light, brighter is the source more objects are visible in the room, if it won't emmit light then dark, Further we can ask to classify the light source weather it is a natural or man made by giving some examples.
Then after we can bring some objects to show the refracting and reflecting nature of light as shown below :

#### various levels
|       |

then after we can implement the above knowledge in a game name "kill thanos".
In this game if the kid throw a solid object then it will damage the health of thanos at max rate compared to liquid and then gas, the damage will depend on the density do the object.

# 25. Measurement and its units
I dont know


# 26. Methods of addition
We can build a game like Mario where the Mario will only jump the hurdle where a hurdle comes with a no attached with it, when the kid gives correct numbers which can sum up equal to the number attached to the hurdle.
Other wise you will reduse the health of Mario or can name any character, can refference to below picture :
